# news_aggregator
Local news is incredibly important. Local news reporters feed the national news ecosystem, they write about issues important to their communities, they offer different perspectives 
than we might otherwise see. Aerhaps most importantly, local news often dedicates serious rescources to investigative reporting and fulfills the promise of the news by minding other
peoples' business and holding the powerful accountable.

I've built a website with Django and Python that scrapes local news papers for article data, and brings it to the user on one webpage with links back to the source.

My intention is to add as many sources as possible including all major and minor local newspapers, school newspapers, and eventually international papers.

This project used a library called newspaper3k which did a great job with a lot of the scraping, some news sites were stubborn and I'm going to write a beautifulsoup scraper shortly.

If you have any comments drop me a message!
